Candy Machine is the leading minting and distribution program for fair NFT collection launches on Solana. It was created by Metaplex, the open protocol and toolset for NFT creators and developers on Solana. Why is it useful? It essentially allows creators to bring their digital assets on-chain in a simple, secure and customisable way.

## key features

- Accept payments in SOL, NFTs or any Solana token
Restrict your launch via start/end dates, mint limits, third party signers, etc
- Protect your launch against bots via configurable bot taxes and gatekeepers like Captchas
- Restrict minting to specific NFT/Token holders or to a curated list of wallets
- Create multiple minting groups with different sets of rules
- Reveal your NFTs after the launch whilst allowing your users to verify that information
